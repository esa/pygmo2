pygmo is a scientific Python library for massively parallel optimization. It is built around the idea
of providing a unified interface to optimization algorithms and to optimization problems and to make their
deployment in massively parallel environments easy.

If you are using pygmo as part of your research, teaching, or other activities, we would be grateful if you could star
the repository and/or cite our work. For citation purposes, you can use the following BibTex entry, which refers
to the [pygmo paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02338) in the Journal of Open Source Software:

```bibtex

The DOI of the latest version of the software is available at [this link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1045336).

## Building and installing from source

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/esa/pygmo2.git
```

## Quick testing

```
python3 -c "import pygmo; pygmo.test.run_test_suite(1); pygmo.mp_island.shutdown_pool(); pygmo.mp_bfe.shutdown_pool()"
```

## Upgrading from pygmo 1.x.x

If you were using the old pygmo, have a look here on some technical data on what and why a completely new API
and code was developed: https://github.com/esa/pagmo2/wiki/From-1.x-to-2.x

You will find many tutorials in the documentation, we suggest to skim through them to realize the differences.
The new pygmo (version 2) should be considered (and is) as an entirely different code.
