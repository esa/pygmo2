    return R"(The population class.

This class represents a population of individuals, i.e., potential candidate solutions to a given problem. In pygmo an
individual is determined:

* by a unique ID used to track him across generations and migrations,
* by a chromosome (a decision vector),
* by the fitness of the chromosome as evaluated by a :class:`~pygmo.problem` and thus including objectives,
  equality constraints and inequality constraints if present.

A special mechanism is implemented to track the best individual that has ever been part of the population. Such an individual
is called *champion* and its decision vector and fitness vector are automatically kept updated. The *champion* is not necessarily
an individual currently in the population. The *champion* is only defined and accessible via the population interface if the
:class:`~pygmo.problem` currently contained in the :class:`~pygmo.population` is single objective.

See also the docs of the C++ class :cpp:class:`pagmo::population`.

Adds one decision vector (chromosome) to the population.

This method will append a new chromosome *x* to the population, creating a new unique identifier for the newly born individual
and, if *f* is not provided, evaluating its fitness. If *f* is provided, the fitness of the new individual will be set to *f*.
It is the user's responsibility to ensure that *f* actually corresponds to the fitness of *x*.

In case of exceptions, the population will not be altered.

Raises:
    ValueError: if the dimensions of *x* or *f* (if provided) are incompatible with the population's problem

std::string problem_docstring()
{
    return R"(__init__(udp = null_problem())

Problem class.

This class represents a generic *mathematical programming* or *evolutionary optimization* problem in the form:

.. math::
   \begin{array}{rl}
   \mbox{find:}      & \mathbf {lb} \le \mathbf x \le \mathbf{ub}\\
   \mbox{to minimize: } & \mathbf f(\mathbf x, s) \in \mathbb R^{n_{obj}}\\
   \mbox{subject to:} & \mathbf {c}_e(\mathbf x, s) = 0 \\
                     & \mathbf {c}_i(\mathbf x, s) \le 0
   \end{array}

where :math:`\mathbf x \in \mathbb R^{n_{cx}} \times  \mathbb Z^{n_{ix}}` is called *decision vector* or
*chromosome*, and is made of :math:`n_{cx}` real numbers and :math:`n_{ix}` integers (all represented as doubles). The
total problem dimension is then indicated with :math:`n_x = n_{cx} + n_{ix}`. :math:`\mathbf{lb}, \mathbf{ub} \in
\mathbb R^{n_{cx}} \times  \mathbb Z^{n_{ix}}` are the *box-bounds*, :math:`\mathbf f: \mathbb R^{n_{cx}} \times
\mathbb Z^{n_{ix}} \rightarrow \mathbb R^{n_{obj}}` define the *objectives*, :math:`\mathbf c_e:  \mathbb R^{n_{cx}}
\times  \mathbb Z^{n_{ix}} \rightarrow \mathbb R^{n_{ec}}` are non linear *equality constraints*, and :math:`\mathbf
c_i:  \mathbb R^{n_{cx}} \times  \mathbb Z^{n_{ix}} \rightarrow \mathbb R^{n_{ic}}` are non linear *inequality
constraints*. Note that the objectives and constraints may also depend from an added value :math:`s` seeding the
values of any number of stochastic variables. This allows also for stochastic programming tasks to be represented by
this class. A tolerance is also considered for all constraints and set, by default, to zero. It can be modified
via the :attr:`~pygmo.problem.c_tol` attribute.

In order to define an optimizaztion problem in pygmo, the user must first define a class
whose methods describe the properties of the problem and allow to compute
the objective function, the gradient, the constraints, etc. In pygmo, we refer to such
a class as a **user-defined problem**, or UDP for short. Once defined and instantiated,
a UDP can then be used to construct an instance of this class, :class:`~pygmo.problem`, which
provides a generic interface to optimization problems.

Every UDP must implement at least the following two methods:

.. code-block::

   def fitness(self, dv):
     ...
   def get_bounds(self):
     ...

The ``fitness()`` method is expected to return the fitness of the input decision vector (concatenating
the objectives, the equality and the inequality constraints), while
``get_bounds()`` is expected to return the box bounds of the problem,
:math:`(\mathbf{lb}, \mathbf{ub})`, which also implicitly define the dimension of the problem.
The ``fitness()`` and ``get_bounds()`` methods of the UDP are accessible from the corresponding
:func:`pygmo.problem.fitness()` and :func:`pygmo.problem.get_bounds()`
methods (see their documentation for information on how the two methods should be implemented
in the UDP and other details).

The two mandatory methods above allow to define a single objective, deterministic, derivative-free, unconstrained
optimization problem. In order to consider more complex cases, the UDP may implement one or more of the following
methods:

.. code-block::

   def get_nobj(self):
     ...
   def get_nec(self):
     ...
   def get_nic(self):
     ...
   def get_nix(self):
     ...
   def batch_fitness(self, dvs):
     ...
   def has_batch_fitness(self):
     ...
   def has_gradient(self):
     ...
   def gradient(self, dv):
     ...
   def has_gradient_sparsity(self):
     ...
   def gradient_sparsity(self):
     ...
   def has_hessians(self):
     ...
   def hessians(self, dv):
     ...
   def has_hessians_sparsity(self):
     ...
   def hessians_sparsity(self):
     ...
   def has_set_seed(self):
     ...
   def set_seed(self, s):
     ...
   def get_name(self):
     ...
   def get_extra_info(self):
     ...

See the documentation of the corresponding methods in this class for details on how the optional
methods in the UDP should be implemented and on how they are used by :class:`~pygmo.problem`.
Note that the exposed C++ problems can also be used as UDPs, even if they do not expose any of the
mandatory or optional methods listed above (see :ref:`here <problems>` for the
full list of UDPs already coded in pygmo).

This class is the Python counterpart of the C++ class :cpp:class:`pagmo::problem`.

Args:
    udp: a user-defined problem, either C++ or Python

Raises:
    NotImplementedError: if *udp* does not implement the mandatory methods detailed above
    ValueError: if the number of objectives of the UDP is zero, the number of objectives,
      equality or inequality constraints is larger than an implementation-defined value,
      the problem bounds are invalid (e.g., they contain NaNs, the dimensionality of the lower bounds is
      different from the dimensionality of the upper bounds, etc. - note that infinite bounds are allowed),
      or if the ``gradient_sparsity()`` and ``hessians_sparsity()`` methods of the UDP fail basic sanity checks
      (e.g., they return vectors with repeated indices, they contain indices exceeding the problem's dimensions, etc.)
    unspecified: any exception thrown by methods of the UDP invoked during construction,
      the deep copy of the UDP, the constructor of the underlying C++ class,
      failures at the intersection between C++ and Python (e.g., type conversion errors, mismatched function
      signatures, etc.)

)";
}

std::string problem_fitness_docstring()
{
    return R"(fitness(dv)

Fitness.

This method will invoke the ``fitness()`` method of the UDP to compute the fitness of the
input decision vector *dv*. The return value of the ``fitness()`` method of the UDP is expected to have a
dimension of :math:`n_{f} = n_{obj} + n_{ec} + n_{ic}` and to contain the concatenated values of
:math:`\mathbf f, \mathbf c_e` and :math:`\mathbf c_i` (in this order).
Equality constraints are all assumed in the form :math:`c_{e_i}(\mathbf x) = 0` while inequalities are assumed in
the form :math:`c_{i_i}(\mathbf x) <= 0` so that negative values are associated to satisfied inequalities.

In addition to invoking the ``fitness()`` method of the UDP, this method will perform sanity checks on
*dv* and on the returned fitness vector. A successful call of this method will increase the internal fitness
evaluation counter (see :func:`~pygmo.problem.get_fevals()`).

The ``fitness()`` method of the UDP must be able to take as input the decision vector as a 1D NumPy array, and it must
return the fitness vector as an iterable Python object (e.g., 1D NumPy array, list, tuple, etc.).

Args:
    dv (array-like object): the decision vector (chromosome) to be evaluated

Returns:
    1D NumPy float array: the fitness of *dv*

Raises:
    ValueError: if either the length of *dv* differs from the value returned by :func:`~pygmo.problem.get_nx()`, or
      the length of the returned fitness vector differs from the value returned by :func:`~pygmo.problem.get_nf()`
    unspecified: any exception thrown by the ``fitness()`` method of the UDP, or by failures at the intersection
      between C++ and Python (e.g., type conversion errors, mismatched function signatures, etc.)

std::string problem_get_bounds_docstring()
{
    return R"(get_bounds()

Box-bounds.

This method will return the box-bounds :math:`(\mathbf{lb}, \mathbf{ub})` of the problem,
as returned by the ``get_bounds()`` method of the UDP. Infinities in the bounds are allowed.

The ``get_bounds()`` method of the UDP must return the box-bounds as a tuple of 2 elements,
the lower bounds vector and the upper bounds vector, which must be represented as iterable Python objects (e.g.,
1D NumPy arrays, lists, tuples, etc.). The box-bounds returned by the UDP are checked upon the construction
of a :class:`~pygmo.problem`.

Returns:
    :class:`tuple`: a tuple of two 1D NumPy float arrays representing the lower and upper box-bounds of the problem

Raises:
    unspecified: any exception thrown by the invoked method of the underlying C++ class, or failures at the

This method will return the lower box-bounds for this problem. See :func:`~pygmo.problem.get_bounds()`
for a detailed explanation of how the bounds are determined.

Returns:
    1D NumPy float array: an array representing the lower box-bounds of this problem

Raises:

{

This method will return the upper box-bounds for this problem. See :func:`~pygmo.problem.get_bounds()`
for a detailed explanation of how the bounds are determined.

Returns:
    1D NumPy float array: an array representing the upper box-bounds of this problem

Raises:

      intersection between C++ and Python (e.g., type conversion errors, mismatched function signatures, etc.)

)";
}

std::string problem_batch_fitness_docstring()
{
    return R"(batch_fitness(dvs)

This method implements the evaluation of multiple decision vectors in batch mode
by invoking the ``batch_fitness()`` method of the UDP. The ``batch_fitness()``
method of the UDP accepts in input a batch of decision vectors, *dvs*, stored contiguously:
for a problem with dimension :math:`n`, the first decision vector in *dvs* occupies
the index range :math:`\left[0, n\right)`, the second decision vector occupies the range
:math:`\left[n, 2n\right)`, and so on. The return value is the batch of fitness vectors *fvs*
resulting from computing the fitness of the input decision vectors.
*fvs* is also stored contiguously: for a problem with fitness dimension :math:`f`, the first fitness
vector will occupy the index range :math:`\left[0, f\right)`, the second fitness vector
will occupy the range :math:`\left[f, 2f\right)`, and so on.

If the UDP provides a ``batch_fitness()`` method, this method will forward ``dvs``
to the ``batch_fitness()`` method of the UDP after sanity checks. The output of the ``batch_fitness()``
method of the UDP will also be checked before being returned. If the UDP does not provide a
``batch_fitness()`` method, an error will be raised.

A successful call of this method will increase the internal fitness evaluation counter
(see :func:`~pygmo.problem.get_fevals()`).

The ``batch_fitness()`` method of the UDP must be able to take as input the decision vectors as a 1D NumPy array,
and it must return the fitness vectors as an iterable Python object (e.g., 1D NumPy array, list, tuple, etc.).

Args:
    dvs (array-like object): the decision vectors (chromosomes) to be evaluated in batch mode

Returns:
    1D NumPy float array: the fitness vectors of *dvs*

Raises:
    ValueError: if *dvs* and/or the return value are not compatible with the problem's properties
    unspecified: any exception thrown by the ``batch_fitness()`` method of the UDP, or by failures at the intersection
      between C++ and Python (e.g., type conversion errors, mismatched function signatures, etc.)

{
    return R"(has_batch_fitness()

Check if the ``batch_fitness()`` method is available in the UDP.

This method will return ``True`` if the ``batch_fitness()`` method is available in the UDP, ``False`` otherwise.

The availability of the ``batch_fitness()`` method is determined as follows:

* if the UDP does not provide a ``batch_fitness()`` method, then this method will always return ``False``;
* if the UDP provides a ``batch_fitness()`` method but it does not provide a ``has_batch_fitness()`` method,
  then this method will always return ``True``;
* if the UDP provides both a ``batch_fitness()`` and a ``has_batch_fitness()`` method, then this method will return
  the output of the ``has_batch_fitness()`` method of the UDP.

The optional ``has_batch_fitness()`` method of the UDP must return a ``bool``. For information on how to
implement the ``batch_fitness()`` method of the UDP, see :func:`~pygmo.problem.batch_fitness()`.

Algorithm class.

This class represents an optimization algorithm. An algorithm can be
stochastic, deterministic, population based, derivative-free, using hessians,
using gradients, a meta-heuristic, evolutionary, etc.. Via this class pygmo offers
a common interface to all types of algorithms that can be applied to find solution
to a generic mathematical programming problem as represented by the
:class:`~pygmo.problem` class.

In order to define an optimizaztion algorithm in pygmo, the user must first define a class
whose methods describe the properties of the algorithm and implement its logic.
In pygmo, we refer to such a class as a **user-defined algorithm**, or UDA for short. Once
defined and instantiated, a UDA can then be used to construct an instance of this class,
:class:`~pygmo.algorithm`, which provides a generic interface to optimization algorithms.

Every UDA must implement at least the following method:

.. code-block::

   def evolve(self, pop):
     ...

The ``evolve()`` method takes as input a :class:`~pygmo.population`, and it is expected to return
a new population generated by the *evolution* (or *optimisation*) of the original population.

Additional optional methods can be implemented in a UDA:

.. code-block::

   def has_set_seed(self):
     ...
   def set_seed(self, s):
     ...
   def has_set_verbosity(self):
     ...
   def set_verbosity(self, l):
     ...
   def get_name(self):
     ...
   def get_extra_info(self):
     ...

See the documentation of the corresponding methods in this class for details on how the optional
methods in the UDA should be implemented and on how they are used by :class:`~pygmo.algorithm`.
Note that the exposed C++ algorithms can also be used as UDAs, even if they do not expose any of the
mandatory or optional methods listed above (see :ref:`here <available_algorithms>` for the
full list of UDAs already coded in pygmo).

This class is the Python counterpart of the C++ class :cpp:class:`pagmo::algorithm`.

Monotonic basin hopping, or simply, basin hopping, is an algorithm rooted in the idea of mapping
the objective function :math:`f(\mathbf x_0)` into the local minima found starting from :math:`\mathbf x_0`.
This simple idea allows a substantial increase of efficiency in solving problems, such as the Lennard-Jones
cluster or the MGA-1DSM interplanetary trajectory problem that are conjectured to have a so-called
funnel structure.

In pygmo we provide an original generalization of this concept resulting in a meta-algorithm that operates
on any :class:`pygmo.population` using any suitable user-defined algorithm (UDA). When a population containing a single
individual is used and coupled with a local optimizer, the original method is recovered.
The pseudo code of our generalized version is:

.. code-block:: none

   > Select a pygmo population
   > Select a UDA
   > Store best individual
   > while i < stop_criteria
   > > Perturb the population in a selected neighbourhood
   > > Evolve the population using the algorithm
   > > if the best individual is improved
   > > > increment i
   > > > update best individual
   > > else

std::string cstrs_self_adaptive_docstring()
{
    return R"(This meta-algorithm implements a constraint handling technique that allows the use of any user-defined algorithm
(UDA) able to deal with single-objective unconstrained problems, on single-objective constrained problems. The
technique self-adapts its parameters during each successive call to the inner UDA basing its decisions on the entire
underlying population. The resulting approach is an alternative to using the meta-problem :class:`~pygmo.unconstrain`
to transform the constrained fitness into an unconstrained fitness.

The self-adaptive constraints handling meta-algorithm is largely based on the ideas of Faramani and Wright but it
extends their use to any-algorithm, in particular to non generational, population based, evolutionary approaches where
a steady-state reinsertion is used (i.e. as soon as an individual is found fit it is immediately reinserted into the
population and will influence the next offspring genetic material).

Each decision vector is assigned an infeasibility measure :math:`\iota` which accounts for the normalized violation of
all the constraints (discounted by the constraints tolerance as returned by :attr:`pygmo.problem.c_tol`). The
normalization factor used :math:`c_{j_{max}}` is the maximum violation of the :math:`j` constraint.

As in the original paper, three individuals in the evolving population are then used to penalize the single
objective.

.. math::
   \begin{array}{rl}
   \check X & \mbox{: the best decision vector} \\
   \hat X & \mbox{: the worst decision vector} \\
   \breve X & \mbox{: the decision vector with the highest objective}
   \end{array}

The best and worst decision vectors are defined accounting for their infeasibilities and for the value of the
objective function. Using the above definitions the overall pseudo code can be summarized as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   > Select a pygmo.population (related to a single-objective constrained problem)
   > Select a UDA (able to solve single-objective unconstrained problems)
   > while i < iter
   > > Compute the normalization factors (will depend on the current population)
   > > Compute the best, worst, highest (will depend on the current population)
   > > Evolve the population using the UDA and a penalized objective
   > > Reinsert the best decision vector from the previous evolution

:class:`pygmo.cstrs_self_adaptive` is a user-defined algorithm (UDA) that can be used to construct :class:`pygmo.algorithm` objects.

.. note::

   Self-adaptive constraints handling implements an internal cache to avoid the re-evaluation of the fitness
   for decision vectors already evaluated. This makes the final counter of fitness evaluations somewhat unpredictable.
   The number of function evaluation will be bounded to *iters* times the fevals made by one call to the inner UDA. The
   internal cache is reset at each iteration, but its size will grow unlimited during each call to
   the inner UDA evolve method.

.. note::

   Several modification were made to the original Faramani and Wright ideas to allow their approach to work on
   corner cases and with any UDAs. Most notably, a violation to the :math:`j`-th  constraint is ignored if all
   the decision vectors in the population satisfy that particular constraint (i.e. if :math:`c_{j_{max}} = 0`).

.. note::

   The performances of :class:`~pygmo.cstrs_self_adaptive` are highly dependent on the particular inner
   algorithm employed and in particular to its parameters (generations / iterations).

Extended Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (gaco).

Ant colony optimization is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions
of an ant colony. Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by
moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions. Real ants lay down
pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment.
The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions,
so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions.

In pygmo we propose a version of this algorithm called extended ACO and originally described
by Schlueter et al.
Extended ACO generates future generations of ants by using the a multi-kernel gaussian distribution
based on three parameters (i.e., pheromone values) which are computed depending on the quality
of each previous solution. The solutions are ranked through an oracle penalty method.

This algorithm can be applied to box-bounded single-objective, constrained and unconstrained
optimization, with both continuous and integer variables.

.. note::

   The ACO version implemented in PaGMO is an extension of Schlueter's originally proposed extended ACO algorithm.
   The main difference between the implemented version  and the original one lies in
   how two of the three pheromone values are computed (in particular, the weights and the standard deviations).

Grey Wolf Optimizer (gwo).

Grey Wolf Optimizer is an optimization algorithm based on the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of
greywolves, proposed by Seyedali Mirjalilia, Seyed Mohammad Mirjalilib, Andrew Lewis in 2014.

This algorithm is a classic example of a highly criticizable line of search that led in the first decades of
our millenia to the development of an entire zoo of metaphors inspiring optimzation heuristics. In our opinion they, 
as is the case for the grey wolf optimizer, are often but small variations of already existing heuristics rebranded with unnecessray and convoluted
biological metaphors. In the case of GWO this is particularly evident as the position update rule is shokingly
trivial and can also be easily seen as a product of an evolutionary metaphor or a particle swarm one. Such an update rule
is also not particulary effective and results in a rather poor performance most of times. Reading the original
peer-reviewed paper, where the poor algorithmic perfromance is hidden by the methodological flaws of the benchmark presented,
one is left with a bitter opinion of the whole peer-review system.

This algorithm can be applied to box-bounded single-objective, constrained and unconstrained
optimization, with continuous value.

    gen (:class:`int`): number of generations

Particle Swarm Optimization (generational) is identical to :class:`~pygmo.pso`, but does update the velocities of each particle before new particle positions are computed (taking
into consideration all updated particle velocities). Each particle is thus evaluated on the same seed within a generation as opposed to the standard PSO which evaluates single particle 
at a time. Consequently, the generational PSO algorithm is suited for stochastic optimization problems.


Args:
    gen (:class:`int`): number of generations
    omega (:class:`float`): inertia weight (or constriction factor)
    eta1 (:class:`float`): social component
    eta2 (:class:`float`): cognitive component
    max_vel (:class:`float`): maximum allowed particle velocities (normalized with respect to the bounds width)
    variant (:class:`int`): algorithmic variant
    neighb_type (:class:`int`): swarm topology (defining each particle's neighbours)
    neighb_param (:class:`int`): topology parameter (defines how many neighbours to consider)
    memory (:class:`bool`): when true the velocities are not reset between successive calls to the evolve method
    seed (:class:`int`): seed used by the internal random number generator (default is random)

Raises:
    OverflowError: if *gen* or *seed* is negative or greater than an implementation-defined value
    ValueError: if *omega* is not in the [0,1] interval, if *eta1*, *eta2* are not in the [0,1] interval, if *max_vel* is not in ]0,1]
    ValueError: *variant* is not one of 1 .. 6, if *neighb_type* is not one of 1 .. 4 or if *neighb_param* is zero

The following variants can be selected via the *variant* parameter:

+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| 1 - Canonical (with inertia weight)     | 2 - Same social and cognitive rand.     |
+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| 3 - Same rand. for all components       | 4 - Only one rand.                      |
+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| 5 - Canonical (with constriction fact.) | 6 - Fully Informed (FIPS)               |
+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+


The following topologies are selected by *neighb_type*:

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| 1 - gbest                            | 2 - lbest                            |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| 3 - Von Neumann                      | 4 - Adaptive random                  |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

The topology determines (together with the topology parameter) which particles need to be considered
when computing the social component of the velocity update.

std::string decompose_docstring()
{
    return R"(The decompose meta-problem.

This meta-problem *decomposes* a multi-objective input user-defined problem,
resulting in a single-objective user-defined problem with a fitness function combining the
original fitness functions. In particular, three different *decomposition methods* are here
made available:

* weighted decomposition,
* Tchebycheff decomposition,
* boundary interception method (with penalty constraint).

In the case of :math:`n` objectives, we indicate with: :math:`\mathbf f(\mathbf x) = [f_1(\mathbf x), \ldots, f_n(\mathbf
x)]` the vector containing the original multiple objectives, with: :math:`\boldsymbol \lambda = (\lambda_1, \ldots,
\lambda_n)` an :math:`n`-dimensional weight vector and with: :math:`\mathbf z^* = (z^*_1, \ldots, z^*_n)`
an :math:`n`-dimensional reference point. We also ussume :math:`\lambda_i > 0, \forall i=1..n` and :math:`\sum_i \lambda_i =
1`.

The decomposed problem is thus a single objective optimization problem having the following single objective,
according to the decomposition method chosen:

* weighted decomposition: :math:`f_d(\mathbf x) = \boldsymbol \lambda \cdot \mathbf f`,
* Tchebycheff decomposition: :math:`f_d(\mathbf x) = \max_{1 \leq i \leq m} \lambda_i \vert f_i(\mathbf x) - z^*_i \vert`,
* boundary interception method (with penalty constraint): :math:`f_d(\mathbf x) = d_1 + \theta d_2`,


where :math:`d_1 = (\mathbf f - \mathbf z^*) \cdot \hat {\mathbf i}_{\lambda}`,
:math:`d_2 = \vert (\mathbf f - \mathbf z^*) - d_1 \hat {\mathbf i}_{\lambda})\vert` and
:math:`\hat {\mathbf i}_{\lambda} = \frac{\boldsymbol \lambda}{\vert \boldsymbol \lambda \vert}`.

.. note:

The reference point :math:`z^*` is often taken as the ideal point and as such
it may be allowed to change during the course of the optimization / evolution. The argument adapt_ideal activates
this behaviour so that whenever a new ideal point is found :math:`z^*` is adapted accordingly.

.. note:

The use of :class:`~pygmo.decompose` discards gradients and hessians so that if the original user defined problem
implements them, they will not be available in the decomposed problem. The reason for this behaviour is that
the Tchebycheff decomposition is not differentiable. Also, the use of this class was originally intended for
derivative-free optimization.

* Weighted violations penalty: penalizes all objectives by the weighted sum of the constraint violations.
* Ignore the constraints: simply ignores the constraints.
* Ignore the objectives: ignores the objectives and defines as a new single objective the overall constraints violation (i.e. the sum of the L2 norms of the equalities and inequalities violations)

.. note:

The use of :class:`~pygmo.unconstrain` discards gradients and hessians so that if the original user defined problem

Failiure to meet this condition will result in undefined behaviour.

While the complexity is the same as that of :func:`~pygmo.sort_population_mo()`, this function is to be preferred when

std::string decompose_objectives_docstring()
{
    return R"(decompose_objectives(objs, weights, ref_point, method)

Decomposes a vector of objectives.

A vector of objectives is reduced to one only objective using a decomposition technique.

Three different possibilities for *method* are here made available:

- weighted decomposition,
- Tchebycheff decomposition,
- boundary interception method (with penalty constraint).

In the case of :math:`n` objectives, we indicate with: :math:`\mathbf f(\mathbf x) = [f_1(\mathbf x), \ldots,
f_n(\mathbf x)]` the vector containing the original multiple objectives, with: :math:`\boldsymbol \lambda =
(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n)` an :math:`n`-dimensional weight vector and with: :math:`\mathbf z^* = (z^*_1, \ldots,
z^*_n)` an :math:`n`-dimensional reference point. We also ussume :math:`\lambda_i > 0, \forall i=1..n` and :math:`\sum_i
\lambda_i = 1`.

The resulting single objective is thus defined as:

- weighted decomposition: :math:`f_d(\mathbf x) = \boldsymbol \lambda \cdot \mathbf f`
- Tchebycheff decomposition: :math:`f_d(\mathbf x) = \max_{1 \leq i \leq m} \lambda_i \vert f_i(\mathbf x) - z^*_i \vert`
- boundary interception method (with penalty constraint): :math:`f_d(\mathbf x) = d_1 + \theta d_2`

where :math:`d_1 = (\mathbf f - \mathbf z^*) \cdot \hat {\mathbf i}_{\lambda}` ,
:math:`d_2 = \vert (\mathbf f - \mathbf z^*) - d_1 \hat {\mathbf i}_{\lambda})\vert` , and 
:math:`\hat {\mathbf i}_{\lambda} = \frac{\boldsymbol \lambda}{\vert \boldsymbol \lambda \vert}`

Note that while `ref_point` is required, it does not impact the calculation for the `weighted` method as shown above.

Args:
    objs (array-like object): the objective vectors
    weights (array-like object): the weights :math:`\boldsymbol \lambda`
    ref_point (array-like object): the reference point :math:`\mathbf z^*` . It is not used if *method* is ``"weighted"``
    method (:class:`str`): the decomposition method: one of ``"weighted"``, ``"tchebycheff"`` or ``"bi"``

Raises:
    ValueError: if *objs*, *weight* and *ref_point* have different sizes or if *method* is not one of ``"weighted"``, ``"tchebycheff"`` or ``"bi"``.
    TypeError: if *weights* or *ref_point* or *objs* cannot be converted to a vector of floats.

Returns:
    1D NumPy float array: a one dimensional array containing the decomposed objective.

Examples:
    >>> import pygmo as pg
    >>> pg.decompose_objectives(objs = [1,2,3], weights = [0.1,0.1,0.8], ref_point=[5,5,5], method = "weighted") # doctest: +SKIP

std::string decomposition_weights_docstring()
{
    return R"(decomposition_weights(n_f, n_w, method, seed)

Generates the requested number of weight vectors to be used to decompose a multi-objective problem. Three methods are available:

- ``"grid"`` generates weights on an uniform grid. This method may only be used when the number of requested weights to be genrated is such that a uniform grid is indeed possible. 
  In two dimensions this is always the case, but in larger dimensions uniform grids are possible only in special cases
- ``"random"`` generates weights randomly distributing them uniformly on the simplex (weights are such that :math:`\sum_i \lambda_i = 1`) 
- ``"low discrepancy"`` generates weights using a low-discrepancy sequence to, eventually, obtain a better coverage of the Pareto front. Halton sequence is used since
  low dimensionalities are expected in the number of objectives (i.e. less than 20), hence Halton sequence is deemed as appropriate.

.. note::  
   All methods are guaranteed to generate weights on the simplex (:math:`\sum_i \lambda_i = 1`). All weight generation methods are guaranteed
   to generate the canonical weights [1,0,0,...], [0,1,0,..], ... first.
 
Args:
    n_f (:class:`int`): number of the objective vectors
    n_w (:class:`int`): number of the weights :math:`\boldsymbol \lambda`
    method (:class:`str`): the weight generation method: one of ``"grid"``, ``"random"``, or ``"low discrepancy"``
    seed (:class:`int`): seed used by the internal random number generator

Raises:
    OverflowError: if *n_f*, *n_w* or *seed* are negative or greater than an implementation-defined value

    return R"(estimate_sparsity(callable, x, dx = 1e-8)

Performs a numerical estimation of the sparsity pattern of same callable object by numerically
computing it around the input point *x* and detecting the components that are changed.

The *callable* must accept an iterable as input and return an array-like object

Note that estimate_sparsity may fail to detect the real sparsity as it only considers one variation around the input
point. It is of use, though, in tests or cases where its not possible to write the sparsity or where the user is
confident the estimate will be correct.

Args:
    callable (a callable object): The function we want to estimate sparsity (typically a fitness).
    x (array-like object): decision vector to use when testing for sparisty.
    dx (:class:`float`): To detect the sparsity each component of *x* will be changed by :math:`\max(|x_i|,1) dx`.

Raises:
    unspecified: any exception thrown by the *callable* object when called on *x*.
    TypeError: if *x* cannot be converted to a vector of floats or *callable* is not callable.

Returns:
    2D NumPy float array: the sparsity_pattern of *callable* detected around *x*

In pygmo it is, in general, possible to control the seed of all random generators by a dedicated *seed* kwarg passed on via various
constructors. If no *seed* is passed pygmo randomly creates a seed for you using its global random number generator. 

This function allows to be able to reset the seed of such a global random number generator. This can be useful to create a deterministic behaviour of pygmo easily. 

Args:
    seed (:class:`int`): the new global seed for random number generation

.. note::
   In complex parallel evolutions obtaining a deterministic behaviour is not possible even setting the global seed as
   pygmo implements an asynchronous model for parallel execution and the exact interplay between threads and processes cannot
   be reproduced deterministically.

std::string island_docstring()
{
    return R"(Island class.

In the pygmo jargon, an island is a class that encapsulates the following entities:

* a user-defined island (**UDI**),
* an :class:`~pygmo.algorithm`,
* a :class:`~pygmo.population`,
* a replacement policy (of type :class:`~pygmo.r_policy`),
* a selection policy (of type :class:`~pygmo.s_policy`).

Through the UDI, the island class manages the asynchronous evolution (or optimisation)
of its :class:`~pygmo.population` via the algorithm's :func:`~pygmo.algorithm.evolve()`
method. Depending on the UDI, the evolution might take place in a separate thread (e.g., if the UDI is a
:class:`~pygmo.thread_island`), in a separate process (e.g., if the UDI is a
:class:`~pygmo.mp_island`) or even in a separate machine (e.g., if the UDI is a
:class:`~pygmo.ipyparallel_island`). The evolution is always asynchronous (i.e., running in the
"background") and it is initiated by a call to the :func:`~pygmo.island.evolve()` method. At any
time the user can query the state of the island and fetch its internal data members. The user can explicitly
wait for pending evolutions to conclude by calling the :func:`~pygmo.island.wait()` and
:func:`~pygmo.island.wait_check()` methods. The status of ongoing evolutions in the island can be queried via
the :attr:`~pygmo.island.status` attribute.

The replacement and selection policies are used when the island is part of an :class:`~pygmo.archipelago`.
They establish how individuals are selected and replaced from the island when migration across islands occurs within
the :class:`~pygmo.archipelago`. If the island is not part of an :class:`~pygmo.archipelago`,
the replacement and selection policies play no role.

Typically, pygmo users will employ an already-available UDI in conjunction with this class (see :ref:`here <available_islands>`
for a full list), but advanced users can implement their own UDI types. A user-defined island must implement
the following method:

.. code-block::

   def run_evolve(self, algo, pop):
     ...

The ``run_evolve()`` method of the UDI will use the input :class:`~pygmo.algorithm`'s
:func:`~pygmo.algorithm.evolve()` method to evolve the input :class:`~pygmo.population` and, once the evolution
is finished, it will return the algorithm used for the evolution and the evolved :class:`~pygmo.population`.

In addition to the mandatory ``run_evolve()`` method, a UDI may implement the following optional methods:

.. code-block::

   def get_name(self):
     ...
   def get_extra_info(self):
     ...

See the documentation of the corresponding methods in this class for details on how the optional
methods in the UDI are used by :class:`~pygmo.island`.

Note that, due to the asynchronous nature of :class:`~pygmo.island`, a UDI has certain requirements regarding
thread safety. Specifically, ``run_evolve()`` is always called in a separate thread of execution, and consequently:

* multiple UDI objects may be calling their own ``run_evolve()`` method concurrently,
* in a specific UDI object, any method from the public API of the UDI may be called while ``run_evolve()`` is
  running concurrently in another thread. Thus, UDI writers must ensure that actions such as copying
  the UDI, calling the optional methods (such as ``get_name()``), etc. can be safely performed while the island
  is evolving.

An island can be initialised in a variety of ways using keyword arguments:

* if the arguments list is empty, a default :class:`~pygmo.island` is constructed, containing a
  :class:`~pygmo.thread_island` UDI, a :class:`~pygmo.null_algorithm` algorithm, an empty
  population with problem type :class:`~pygmo.null_problem`, and default-constructed
  :class:`~pygmo.r_policy` and :class:`~pygmo.s_policy`;
* if the arguments list contains *algo*, *pop* and, optionally, *udi*, *r_pol* and *s_pol*, then the constructor will
  initialise an :class:`~pygmo.island` containing the specified algorithm, population, UDI and replacement/selection
  policies. If *r_pol* and/or *s_pol* are not supplied, the replacement/selection policies will be default-constructed.
  If the *udi* parameter is not supplied, the UDI type is chosen according to a heuristic which depends
  on the platform, the Python version and the supplied *algo* and *pop* parameters:

  * if *algo* and *pop*'s problem provide at least the ``basic`` :class:`~pygmo.thread_safety` guarantee,
    then :class:`~pygmo.thread_island` will be selected as UDI type;
  * otherwise, if the current platform is Windows or the Python version is at least 3.4, then :class:`~pygmo.mp_island`
    will be selected as UDI type, else :class:`~pygmo.ipyparallel_island` will be chosen;
* if the arguments list contains *algo*, *prob*, *size* and, optionally, *udi*, *b*, *seed*, *r_pol* and *s_pol*,
  then a :class:`~pygmo.population` will be constructed from *prob*, *size*, *b* and *seed*, and the construction will
  then proceed in the same way detailed above (i.e., *algo* and the newly-created population are used to initialise the
  island's algorithm and population, the UDI, if not specified, will be chosen according to the heuristic detailed above,
  and the replacement/selection policies are given by *r_pol* and *s_pol*).

If the keyword arguments list is invalid, a :exc:`KeyError` exception will be raised.

This class is the Python counterpart of the C++ class :cpp:class:`pagmo::island`.

}

std::string island_evolve_docstring()
{
    return R"(evolve(n = 1)

Launch evolution.

This method will evolve the island's :class:`~pygmo.population` using the island's :class:`~pygmo.algorithm`.
The evolution happens asynchronously: a call to :func:`~pygmo.island.evolve()` will create an evolution task that
will be pushed to a queue, and then return immediately. The tasks in the queue are consumed by a separate thread of execution
managed by the :class:`~pygmo.island` object. Each task will invoke the ``run_evolve()`` method of the UDI *n*
times consecutively to perform the actual evolution. The island's algorithm and population will be updated at the
end of each ``run_evolve()`` invocation. Exceptions raised inside the tasks are stored within the island object,
and can be re-raised by calling :func:`~pygmo.island.wait_check()`.

If the island is part of an :class:`~pygmo.archipelago`, then migration of individuals to/from other
islands might occur. The migration algorithm consists of the following steps:

* before invoking ``run_evolve()`` on the UDI, the island will ask the
  archipelago if there are candidate incoming individuals from other islands
  If so, the replacement policy is invoked and the current population of the island is updated with the migrants;
* ``run_evolve()`` is then invoked and the current population is evolved;
* after ``run_evolve()`` has concluded, individuals are selected in the
  evolved population and copied into the migration database of the archipelago
  for future migrations.

It is possible to call this method multiple times to enqueue multiple evolution tasks, which will be consumed in a FIFO (first-in
first-out) fashion. The user may call :func:`~pygmo.island.wait()` or :func:`~pygmo.island.wait_check()` to block until all
tasks have been completed, and to fetch exceptions raised during the execution of the tasks. The :attr:`~pygmo.island.status`
attribute can be used to query the status of the asynchronous operations in the island.

Args:
     n (:class:`int`): the number of times the ``run_evolve()`` method of the UDI will be called within the evolution task
        (this corresponds also to the number of times migration can happen, if the island belongs to an archipelago)

Raises:
    IndexError: if the island is part of an archipelago and during migration an invalid island index is used (this can
       happen if the archipelago's topology is malformed)

std::string thread_island_docstring()
{
    return R"(__init__(use_pool=True)

Thread island.

This class is a user-defined island (UDI) that will run evolutions in
a separate thread of execution. Evolution tasks running on this
UDI must involve :class:`~pygmo.algorithm` and :class:`~pygmo.problem` instances
that provide at least the ``basic`` :class:`~pygmo.thread_safety` guarantee, otherwise
errors will be raised during the evolution.

Note that algorithms and problems implemented in Python are never considered thread safe, and thus
this UDI can be used only with algorithms and problems implemented in C++.

The *use_pool* flag signals whether or not this island should use a common thread pool
shared by all islands.

Using a thread pool is more computationally-efficient, for at least
two reasons:

* it avoids runtime overhead when
  the number of islands evolving simultaneously is larger than the CPU
  count (e.g., in a large :class:`~pygmo.archipelago`);
* because the implementation uses the Intel TBB libraries, it integrates
  better with other pagmo facilities built on top of TBB (e.g., the
  :class:`~pygmo.thread_bfe` batch fitness evaluator).

A thread pool however also introduces a serializing behaviour because the number
of evolutions actually running at the same time is limited by the CPU
count (whereas without the thread pool an unlimited number of evolutions
can be active at the same time, albeit with a performance penalty).

See also the documentation of the corresponding C++ class :cpp:class:`pagmo::thread_island`.

An archipelago is a collection of :class:`~pygmo.island` objects connected by a
:class:`~pygmo.topology`. The islands in the archipelago can exchange individuals
(i.e., candidate solutions) via a process called *migration*. The individuals migrate
across the routes described by the topology, and the islands' replacement
and selection policies (see :class:`~pygmo.r_policy` and :class:`~pygmo.s_policy`)
establish how individuals are replaced in and selected from the islands' populations.

The interface of :class:`~pygmo.archipelago` mirrors partially the interface
of :class:`~pygmo.island`: the evolution is initiated by a call to :func:`~pygmo.archipelago.evolve()`,
and at any time the user can query the
state of the archipelago and access its island members. The user can explicitly wait for pending evolutions
to conclude by calling the :func:`~pygmo.archipelago.wait()` and :func:`~pygmo.archipelago.wait_check()`
methods. The status of ongoing evolutions in the archipelago can be queried via
:func:`~pygmo.archipelago.status()`.

NLopt algorithms.

This user-defined algorithm wraps a selection of solvers from the
`NLopt <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ library, focusing on
local optimisation (both gradient-based and derivative-free). The complete list of supported
NLopt algorithms is:

* COBYLA,
* BOBYQA,
* NEWUOA + bound constraints,
* PRAXIS,
* Nelder-Mead simplex,
* sbplx,
* MMA (Method of Moving Asymptotes),
* CCSA,
* SLSQP,
* low-storage BFGS,
* preconditioned truncated Newton,
* shifted limited-memory variable-metric,
* augmented Lagrangian algorithm.

The desired NLopt solver is selected upon construction of an :class:`~pygmo.nlopt` algorithm. Various properties
of the solver (e.g., the stopping criteria) can be configured via class attributes. Multiple
stopping criteria can be active at the same time: the optimisation will stop as soon as at least one stopping criterion
is satisfied. By default, only the ``xtol_rel`` stopping criterion is active (see :attr:`~pygmo.nlopt.xtol_rel`).

All NLopt solvers support only single-objective optimisation, and, as usual in pygmo, minimisation
is always assumed. The gradient-based algorithms require the optimisation problem to provide a gradient.
Some solvers support equality and/or inequality constraints. The constraints' tolerances will
be set to those specified in the :class:`~pygmo.problem` being optimised (see :attr:`pygmo.problem.c_tol`).

In order to support pygmo's population-based optimisation model, the ``evolve()`` method will select
a single individual from the input :class:`~pygmo.population` to be optimised by the NLopt solver.
If the optimisation produces a better individual (as established by :func:`~pygmo.compare_fc()`),
the optimised individual will be inserted back into the population.
The selection and replacement strategies can be configured via the :attr:`~pygmo.nlopt.selection`
and :attr:`~pygmo.nlopt.replacement` attributes.

.. note::

   This user-defined algorithm is available only if pygmo was compiled with the ``PAGMO_WITH_NLOPT`` option
   enabled (see the :ref:`installation instructions <install>`).

Harmony search (HS) is a metaheuristic algorithm said to mimick the improvisation process of musicians.
In the metaphor, each musician (i.e., each variable) plays (i.e., generates) a note (i.e., a value)
for finding a best harmony (i.e., the global optimum) all together.

This pygmo UDA implements the so-called improved harmony search algorithm (IHS), in which the probability
of picking the variables from the decision vector and the amount of mutation to which they are subject
vary (respectively linearly and exponentially) at each call of the ``evolve()`` method.

In this algorithm the number of fitness function evaluations is equal to the number of iterations.
All the individuals in the input population participate in the evolution. A new individual is generated
at every iteration, substituting the current worst individual of the population if better.

.. warning::

   The HS algorithm can and has been  criticized, not for its performances,
   but for the use of a metaphor that does not add anything to existing ones. The HS
   algorithm essentially applies mutation and crossover operators to a background population and as such
   should have been developed in the context of Evolutionary Strategies or Genetic Algorithms and studied
   in that context. The use of the musicians metaphor only obscures its internal functioning
   making theoretical results from ES and GA erroneously seem as unapplicable to HS.

.. note::

   The original IHS algorithm was designed to solve unconstrained, deterministic single objective problems.
   In pygmo, the algorithm was modified to tackle also multi-objective, constrained (box and non linearly).
   Such extension is original with pygmo.

Args:
    gen (:class:`int`): number of generations to consider (each generation will compute the objective function once)
    phmcr (:class:`float`): probability of choosing from memory (similar to a crossover probability)

A Simple Genetic Algorithm

.. versionadded:: 2.2

Approximately during the same decades as Evolutionary Strategies (see :class:`~pygmo.sea`) were studied, 
a different group led by John Holland, and later by his student David Goldberg, introduced and
studied an algorithmic framework called "genetic algorithms" that were, essentially, leveraging on
the same idea but introducing also crossover as a genetic operator. This led to a few decades of
confusion and discussions on what was an evolutionary startegy and what a genetic algorithm and on
whether the crossover was a useful operator or mutation only algorithms were to be preferred.

In pygmo we provide a rather classical implementation of a genetic algorithm, letting the user choose between
selected crossover types, selection schemes and mutation types.

The pseudo code of our version is:

.. code-block:: none

   > Start from a population (pop) of dimension N
   > while i < gen
   > > Selection: create a new population (pop2) with N individuals selected from pop (with repetition allowed)
   > > Crossover: create a new population (pop3) with N individuals obtained applying crossover to pop2
   > > Mutation:  create a new population (pop4) with N individuals obtained applying mutation to pop3
   > > Evaluate all new chromosomes in pop4
   > > Reinsertion: set pop to contain the best N individuals taken from pop and pop4

The various blocks of pygmo genetic algorithm are listed below:

*Selection*: two selection methods are provided: ``tournament`` and ``truncated``. ``Tournament`` selection works by
selecting each offspring as the one having the minimal fitness in a random group of size *param_s*. The ``truncated``
selection, instead, works selecting the best *param_s* chromosomes in the entire population over and over.
We have deliberately not implemented the popular roulette wheel selection as we are of the opinion that such
a system does not generalize much being highly sensitive to the fitness scaling.

*Crossover*: four different crossover schemes are provided:``single``, ``exponential``, ``binomial``, ``sbx``. The
``single`` point crossover, works selecting a random point in the parent chromosome and, with probability *cr*, inserting the
partner chromosome thereafter. The ``exponential`` crossover is taken from the algorithm differential evolution,
implemented, in pygmo, as :class:`~pygmo.de`. It essentially selects a random point in the parent chromosome and inserts,
in each successive gene, the partner values with probability  *cr* up to when it stops. The binomial crossover
inserts each gene from the partner with probability *cr*. The simulated binary crossover (called ``sbx``), is taken
from the NSGA-II algorithm, implemented in pygmo as :class:`~pygmo.nsga2`, and makes use of an additional parameter called
distribution index *eta_c*.

*Mutation*: three different mutations schemes are provided: ``uniform``, ``gaussian`` and ``polynomial``. Uniform mutation
simply randomly samples from the bounds. Gaussian muattion samples around each gene using a normal distribution
with standard deviation proportional to the *param_m* and the bounds width. The last scheme is the ``polynomial``
mutation from Deb.

*Reinsertion*: the only reinsertion strategy provided is what we call pure elitism. After each generation
all parents and children are put in the same pool and only the best are passed to the next generation.
 
.. note:

   This algorithm will work only for box bounded problems.

    param_s (:class:`float`): the number of best individuals to use in "truncated" selection or the size of the tournament in ``tournament`` selection.
    crossover (:class:`str`): the crossover strategy. One of ``exponential``, ``binomial``, ``single`` or ``sbx``
    mutation (:class:`str`): the mutation strategy. One of ``gaussian``, ``polynomial`` or ``uniform``.

Ipopt.

.. versionadded:: 2.2

This class is a user-defined algorithm (UDA) that wraps the Ipopt (Interior Point OPTimizer) solver,
a software package for large-scale nonlinear optimization. Ipopt is a powerful solver that
is able to handle robustly and efficiently constrained nonlinear opimization problems at high dimensionalities.

Ipopt supports only single-objective minimisation, and it requires the availability of the gradient in the
optimisation problem. If possible, for best results the Hessians should be provided as well (but Ipopt
can estimate numerically the Hessians if needed).

In order to support pygmo's population-based optimisation model, the ``evolve()`` method will select
a single individual from the input :class:`~pygmo.population` to be optimised.
If the optimisation produces a better individual (as established by :func:`~pygmo.compare_fc()`),
the optimised individual will be inserted back into the population. The selection and replacement strategies
can be configured via the :attr:`~pygmo.ipopt.selection` and :attr:`~pygmo.ipopt.replacement` attributes.

Ipopt supports a large amount of options for the configuration of the optimisation run. The options
are divided into three categories:

* *string* options (i.e., the type of the option is :class:`str`),
* *integer* options (i.e., the type of the option is :class:`int`),
* *numeric* options (i.e., the type of the option is :class:`float`).

The full list of options is available on the `Ipopt website <https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/OPTIONS.html>`__.
:class:`pygmo.ipopt` allows to configure any Ipopt option via methods such as :func:`~pygmo.ipopt.set_string_options()`,
:func:`~pygmo.ipopt.set_string_option()`, :func:`~pygmo.ipopt.set_integer_options()`, etc., which need to be used before
invoking the ``evolve()`` method.

If the user does not set any option, :class:`pygmo.ipopt` use Ipopt's default values for the options (see the
`documentation <https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/OPTIONS.html>`__), with the following
modifications:

* if the ``"print_level"`` integer option is **not** set by the user, it will be set to 0 by :class:`pygmo.ipopt` (this will
  suppress most screen output produced by the solver - note that we support an alternative form of logging via
  the :func:`pygmo.algorithm.set_verbosity()` machinery);
* if the ``"hessian_approximation"`` string option is **not** set by the user and the optimisation problem does
  **not** provide the Hessians, then the option will be set to ``"limited-memory"`` by :class:`pygmo.ipopt`. This makes it
  possible to optimise problems without Hessians out-of-the-box (i.e., Ipopt will approximate numerically the
  Hessians for you);
* if the ``"constr_viol_tol"`` numeric option is **not** set by the user and the optimisation problem is constrained,
  then :class:`pygmo.ipopt` will compute the minimum value ``min_tol`` in the vector returned by :attr:`pygmo.problem.c_tol`
  for the optimisation problem at hand. If ``min_tol`` is nonzero, then the ``"constr_viol_tol"`` Ipopt option will
  be set to ``min_tol``, otherwise the default Ipopt value (1E-4) will be used for the option. This ensures that,
  if the constraint tolerance is not explicitly set by the user, a solution deemed feasible by Ipopt is also
  deemed feasible by pygmo (but the opposite is not necessarily true).

.. note::

   This user-defined algorithm is available only if pygmo was compiled with the ``PAGMO_WITH_IPOPT`` option
   enabled (see the :ref:`installation instructions <install>`).

.. note::

   Ipopt is not thread-safe, and thus it cannot be used in a :class:`pygmo.thread_island`.

.. seealso::

Examples:
    >>> from pygmo import *
    >>> ip = ipopt()
    >>> ip.set_numeric_option("tol",1E-9) # Change the relative convergence tolerance
    >>> ip.get_numeric_options() # doctest: +SKIP
    {'tol': 1e-09}
    >>> algo = algorithm(ip)
    >>> algo.set_verbosity(1)
    >>> prob = problem(luksan_vlcek1(20))
    >>> prob.c_tol = [1E-6] * 18 # Set constraints tolerance to 1E-6
    >>> pop = population(prob, 20)
    >>> pop = algo.evolve(pop) # doctest: +SKIP

std::string ipopt_get_log_docstring()
{
    return R"(get_log()

Optimisation log.

The optimisation log is a collection of log data lines. A log data line is a tuple consisting of:

* the number of objective function evaluations made so far,
* the objective function value for the current decision vector,
* the number of constraints violated by the current decision vector,
* the constraints violation norm for the current decision vector,
* a boolean flag signalling the feasibility of the current decision vector.

Returns:
    :class:`list`: the optimisation log

Raises:
    unspecified: any exception thrown by failures at the intersection between C++ and Python (e.g.,
      type conversion errors, mismatched function signatures, etc.)

.. warning::

   The number of constraints violated, the constraints violation norm and the feasibility flag stored in the log
   are all determined via the facilities and the tolerances specified within :class:`pygmo.problem`. That
   is, they might not necessarily be consistent with Ipopt's notion of feasibility. See the explanation
   of how the ``"constr_viol_tol"`` numeric option is handled in :class:`pygmo.ipopt`.

.. note::

   Ipopt supports its own logging format and protocol, including the ability to print to screen and write to file.
   Ipopt's screen logging is disabled by default (i.e., the Ipopt verbosity setting is set to 0 - see
   :class:`pygmo.ipopt`). On-screen logging can be enabled via the ``"print_level"`` string option.

std::string bfe_docstring()

Batch fitness evaluator.

This class implements the evaluation of decision vectors in batch mode. That is,
whereas a :class:`pygmo.problem` provides the means to evaluate a single decision
vector via the :func:`pygmo.problem.fitness()` method, a
:class:`~pygmo.bfe` (short for *batch fitness evaluator*) enables a :class:`~pygmo.problem`
to evaluate the fitnesses of a group (or a *batch*) of decision vectors, possibly
in a parallel/vectorised fashion.

Together with the :func:`pygmo.problem.batch_fitness()` method,
:class:`~pygmo.bfe` is one of the mechanisms provided
by pagmo to enable a form of parallelism on a finer level than the
:class:`~pygmo.archipelago` and :class:`~pygmo.island` classes.
However, while the :func:`pygmo.problem.batch_fitness()` method must be
implemented on a UDP-by-UDP basis, a :class:`~pygmo.bfe`
provides generic batch fitness evaluation capabilities for any :class:`~pygmo.problem`,
and it can thus be used also with UDPs which do not implement the
:func:`pygmo.problem.batch_fitness()` method.

Like :class:`~pygmo.problem`, :class:`~pygmo.algorithm`, and many other
pagmo classes, :class:`~pygmo.bfe` is a generic container
which stores internally
a user-defined batch fitness evaluator (UDBFE for short) which actually
implements the fitness evaluation in batch mode. Users are free to either
use one of the evaluators provided with pagmo, or to write their own UDBFE.

Every UDBFE must be a callable (i.e., a function or a class with a call
operator) with a signature equivalent to

.. code-block::

   def __call__(self, prob, dvs):
     ...

UDBFEs receive in input a :class:`~pygmo.problem` and a batch of decision vectors
stored contiguously in an array-like object, and they return
a NumPy array containing the fitness vectors
corresponding to the input batch of decision vectors (as evaluated by the input problem and
stored contiguously).

UDBFEs can also implement the following (optional) methods:

.. code-block::

   def get_name(self):
     ...
   def get_extra_info(self):
     ...

See the documentation of the corresponding methods in this class for details on how the optional
methods in the UDBFE are used by :class:`~pygmo.bfe`.

This class is the Python counterpart of the C++ class :cpp:class:`pagmo::bfe`.

Args:
    udbfe: a user-defined batch fitness evaluator, either C++ or Python

Raises:
    NotImplementedError: if *udbfe* does not implement the mandatory methods detailed above
    unspecified: any exception thrown by methods of the UDBFE invoked during construction,

std::string topology_docstring()
{
    return R"(__init__(udt = unconnected())

Topology.

In the jargon of pagmo, a topology is an object that represents connections among
:class:`islands <pygmo.island>` in an :class:`~pygmo.archipelago`.
In essence, a topology is a *weighted directed graph* in which

* the *vertices* (or *nodes*) are islands,
* the *edges* (or *arcs*) are directed connections between islands across which information flows during the
  optimisation process (via the migration of individuals),
* the *weights* of the edges (whose numerical values are the :math:`[0.,1.]` range) represent the migration
  probability.

Following the same schema adopted for :class:`~pygmo.problem`, :class:`~pygmo.algorithm`, etc.,
:class:`~pygmo.topology` exposes a generic interface to *user-defined topologies* (or UDT for short).
UDTs are classes providing a certain set
of methods that describe the properties of (and allow to interact with) a topology. Once
defined and instantiated, a UDT can then be used to construct an instance of this class,
:class:`~pygmo.topology`, which provides a generic interface to topologies for use by
:class:`~pygmo.archipelago`.

In a :class:`~pygmo.topology`, vertices in the graph are identified by a zero-based unique
integral index. This integral index corresponds to the index of an
:class:`~pygmo.island` in an :class:`~pygmo.archipelago`.

Every UDT must implement at least the following methods:

.. code-block::

   def get_connections(self, n):
     ...
   def push_back(self):
     ...

The ``get_connections()`` method takes as input a vertex index ``n``, and it is expected to return
a pair of array-like values containing respectively:

* the indices of the vertices which are connecting to ``n`` (that is, the list of vertices for which a directed edge
  towards ``n`` exists),
* the weights (i.e., the migration probabilities) of the edges linking the connecting vertices to ``n``.

The ``push_back()`` method is expected to add a new vertex to the topology, assigning it the next
available index and establishing connections to other vertices. The ``push_back()`` method is invoked
by :func:`pygmo.archipelago.push_back()` upon the insertion of a new island into an archipelago,
and it is meant to allow the incremental construction of a topology. That is, after ``N`` calls to ``push_back()``
on an initially-empty topology, the topology should contain ``N`` vertices and any number of edges (depending
on the specifics of the topology).

Additional optional methods can be implemented in a UDT:

.. code-block::

   def get_name(self):
     ...
   def get_extra_info(self):
     ...
   def to_networkx(self):
     ...

See the documentation of the corresponding methods in this class for details on how the optional
methods in the UDT are used by :class:`~pygmo.topology`.

Topologies are used in asynchronous operations involving migration in archipelagos,
and thus they need to provide a certain degree of thread safety. Specifically, the
``get_connections()`` method of the UDT might be invoked concurrently with
any other method of the UDT interface. It is up to the
authors of user-defined topologies to ensure that this safety requirement is satisfied.

Replacement policy.

A replacement policy establishes
how, during migration within an :class:`~pygmo.archipelago`,
a group of migrants replaces individuals in an existing
:class:`~pygmo.population`. In other words, a replacement
policy is tasked with producing a new set of individuals from
an original set of individuals and a set of candidate migrants.

Following the same schema adopted for :class:`~pygmo.problem`, :class:`~pygmo.algorithm`, etc.,
:class:`~pygmo.r_policy` exposes a generic
interface to *user-defined replacement policies* (or UDRP for short).
UDRPs are classes providing a certain set
of methods that implement the logic of the replacement policy. Once
defined and instantiated, a UDRP can then be used to construct an instance of this class,
:class:`~pygmo.r_policy`, which
provides a generic interface to replacement policies for use by :class:`~pygmo.island`.

Every UDRP must implement at least the following method:

.. code-block::

   def replace(self, inds, nx, nix, nobj, nec, nic, tol, mig):
     ...

The ``replace()`` method takes in input the following parameters:

* a group of individuals *inds*,
* a set of arguments describing the properties of the :class:`~pygmo.problem` the individuals refer to:

  * the total dimension *nx*,
  * the integral dimension *nix*,
  * the number of objectives *nobj*,
  * the number of equality constraints *nec*,
  * the number of inequality constraints *nic*,
  * the problem's constraint tolerances *tol*,

* a set of migrants *mig*,

and it produces in output another set of individuals resulting from replacing individuals in *inds* with
individuals from *mig* (following some logic established by the UDRP). The sets of individuals *inds* and
*mig*, and the return value of the ``replace()`` method are represented as tuples of 3 elements containing:

* a 1D NumPy array of individual IDs (represented as 64-bit unsigned integrals),
* a 2D NumPy array of decision vectors (i.e., the decision vectors of each individual,
  stored in row-major order),
* a 2D NumPy array of fitness vectors (i.e., the fitness vectors of each individual,
  stored in row-major order).

Additional optional methods can be implemented in a UDRP:

   def get_extra_info(self):

See the documentation of the corresponding methods in this class for details on how the optional
methods in the UDRP are used by :class:`~pygmo.r_policy`.

Replacement policies are used in asynchronous operations involving migration in archipelagos,
and thus they need to provide a certain degree of thread safety. Specifically, the
``replace()`` method of the UDRP might be invoked concurrently with
any other method of the UDRP interface. It is up to the

Fair replacement policy.

This user-defined replacement policy (UDRP) will replace individuals in
a group only if the candidate replacement individuals are *better* than
the original individuals.

In this context, *better* means the following:

* in single-objective unconstrained problems, an individual is better
  than another one if its fitness is lower,
* in single-objective constrained problems, individuals are ranked
  via :func:`~pygmo.sort_population_con()`,
* in multi-objective unconstrained problems, individuals are ranked
  via :func:`~pygmo.sort_population_mo()`.

Note that this user-defined replacement policy currently does *not* support
multi-objective constrained problems.

A fair replacement policy is constructed from a *rate* argument, which
can be either an integral or a floating-point value.

If *rate* is a floating point value in the :math:`\left[0,1\right]` range,
then it represents a *fractional* migration rate. That is, it indicates,
the fraction of individuals that may be replaced in the input population:
a value of 0 means that no individuals will be replaced, a value of 1 means that
all individuals may be replaced.

If *rate* is an integral value, then it represents an *absolute* migration rate, that is,
the exact number of individuals that may be replaced in the input population.

Selection policy.

A selection policy establishes
how, during migration within an :class:`~pygmo.archipelago`,
candidate migrants are selected from an :class:`~pygmo.island`.

Following the same schema adopted for :class:`~pygmo.problem`, :class:`~pygmo.algorithm`, etc.,
:class:`~pygmo.s_policy` exposes a generic
interface to *user-defined selection policies* (or UDSP for short).
UDSPs are classes providing a certain set of methods that implement the logic of the selection policy. Once
defined and instantiated, a UDSP can then be used to construct an instance of this class,
:class:`~pygmo.s_policy`, which
provides a generic interface to selection policies for use by :class:`~pygmo.island`.

Every UDSP must implement at least the following method:

.. code-block::

   def select(self, inds, nx, nix, nobj, nec, nic, tol):
     ...

The ``select()`` method takes in input the following parameters:

* a group of individuals *inds*,
* a set of arguments describing the properties of the :class:`~pygmo.problem` the individuals refer to:

  * the total dimension *nx*,
  * the integral dimension *nix*,
  * the number of objectives *nobj*,
  * the number of equality constraints *nec*,
  * the number of inequality constraints *nic*,
  * the problem's constraint tolerances *tol*,

and it produces in output another set of individuals resulting from selecting individuals in *inds*
(following some logic established by the UDSP). The sets of individuals *inds*
and the return value of the ``select()`` method are represented as tuples of 3 elements containing:

* a 1D NumPy array of individual IDs (represented as 64-bit unsigned integrals),
* a 2D NumPy array of decision vectors (i.e., the decision vectors of each individual,
  stored in row-major order),
* a 2D NumPy array of fitness vectors (i.e., the fitness vectors of each individual,
  stored in row-major order).

Additional optional methods can be implemented in a UDSP:

.. code-block::

   def get_name(self):
     ...
   def get_extra_info(self):
     ...

See the documentation of the corresponding methods in this class for details on how the optional
methods in the UDSP are used by :class:`~pygmo.s_policy`.

Selection policies are used in asynchronous operations involving migration in archipelagos,
and thus they need to provide a certain degree of thread safety. Specifically, the
``select()`` method of the UDSP might be invoked concurrently with
any other method of the UDSP interface. It is up to the
authors of user-defined selection policies to ensure that this safety requirement is satisfied.

This class is the Python counterpart of the C++ class :cpp:class:`pagmo::s_policy`.

Args:
    udsp: a user-defined selection policy, either C++ or Python

Raises:
    NotImplementedError: if *udsp* does not implement the mandatory methods detailed above
    unspecified: any exception thrown by methods of the UDSP invoked during construction,
      the deep copy of the UDSP, the constructor of the underlying C++ class, or
      failures at the intersection between C++ and Python (e.g., type conversion errors, mismatched function
      signatures, etc.)

std::string s_policy_select_docstring()
{
    return R"(select(inds, nx, nix, nobj, nec, nic, tol)

Select individuals from a group.

This method will invoke the ``select()`` method of the UDSP.
Given a set of individuals, *inds*, the ``select()`` method of the UDSP
is expected to return a new set of individuals selected from *inds*.
The other arguments of this method describe the properties of the :class:`~pygmo.problem`
that the individuals in *inds* refer to.

The set of individuals *inds* and the return value of this method are
represented as tuples of 3 elements containing:

* a 1D NumPy array of individual IDs (represented as 64-bit unsigned integrals),
* a 2D NumPy array of decision vectors (i.e., the decision vectors of each individual,
  stored in row-major order),
* a 2D NumPy array of fitness vectors (i.e., the fitness vectors of each individual,
  stored in row-major order).

In addition to invoking the ``select()`` method of the UDSP, this function will also
perform a variety of sanity checks on both the input arguments and on the output produced by the
UDSP.

Args:
    inds (tuple): the original group of individuals
    nx (:class:`int`): the dimension of the problem *inds* refers to
    nix (:class:`int`): the integral dimension of the problem *inds* refers to
    nobj (:class:`int`): the number of objectives of the problem *inds* refers to
    nec (:class:`int`): the number of equality constraints of the problem *inds* refers to
    nic (:class:`int`): the number of inequality constraints of the problem *inds* refers to
    tol (array-like object): the vector of constraints tolerances of the problem *inds* refers to

Returns:
    tuple: a new set of individuals resulting from selecting individuals in *inds*.

Raises:
    RuntimeError: if the object returned by a pythonic UDSP is not iterable, or it is an iterable
       whose number of elements is not exactly 3, or if the invocation of the ``select()``
       method of the UDSP raises an exception
    ValueError: if *inds* or the return value are not consistent with the problem properties,
       or the ID, decision and fitness vectors in *inds* or the return value have inconsistent sizes,
       or the problem properties are invalid (e.g., *nobj* is zero, *nix* > *nx*, etc.)
    unspecified: any exception raised by failures at the intersection
       between C++ and Python (e.g., type conversion errors, mismatched function signatures, etc.)

}

std::string s_policy_get_name_docstring()
{
    return R"(get_name()

Name of the selection policy.

If the UDSP provides a ``get_name()`` method, then this method will return the output of its ``get_name()`` method.
Otherwise, an implementation-defined name based on the type of the UDSP will be returned.

Returns:
    str: the name of the selection policy

)";
}

std::string s_policy_get_extra_info_docstring()
{
    return R"(get_extra_info()

Selection policy's extra info.

If the UDSP provides a ``get_extra_info()`` method, then this method will return the output of its ``get_extra_info()``
method. Otherwise, an empty string will be returned.

Returns:
  str: extra info about the UDSP

Raises:
  unspecified: any exception thrown by the ``get_extra_info()`` method of the UDSP

)";
}

std::string select_best_docstring()
{
    return R"(__init__(rate=1)

Select best selection policy.

This user-defined selection policy (UDSP) will select the *best*
individuals from a group.

In this context, *best* means the following:

* in single-objective unconstrained problems, individuals are ranked
  according to their fitness function,
* in single-objective constrained problems, individuals are ranked
  via :func:`~pygmo.sort_population_con()`,
* in multi-objective unconstrained problems, individuals are ranked
  via :func:`~pygmo.sort_population_mo()`.

Note that this user-defined selection policy currently does *not* support
multi-objective constrained problems.

A select best policy is constructed from a *rate* argument, which
can be either an integral or a floating-point value.

If *rate* is a floating point value in the :math:`\left[0,1\right]` range,
then it represents a *fractional* migration rate. That is, it indicates,
the fraction of individuals that will be selected from the input population:
a value of 0 means that no individuals will be selected, a value of 1 means that
all individuals will be selected.

If *rate* is an integral value, then it represents an *absolute* migration rate, that is,
the exact number of individuals that will be selected from the input population.

See also the docs of the C++ class :cpp:class:`pagmo::select_best`.

Args:
    rate (int, float): the desired migration rate

Raises:
    ValueError: if the supplied fractional migration rate is not finite
      or not in the :math:`\left[0,1\right]` range
    TypeError: if *rate* is not an instance of :class:`int` or :class:`float`
    unspecified: any exception raised by the invoked C++ constructor
