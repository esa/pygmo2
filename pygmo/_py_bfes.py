    """Multiprocessing batch fitness evaluator.

    .. versionadded:: 2.13

    This user-defined batch fitness evaluator (UDBFE) will dispatch
    the fitness evaluation in batch mode of a set of decision vectors
    to a process pool created and managed via the facilities of the
    standard Python :mod:`multiprocessing` module.

    The evaluations of the decision vectors are dispatched to the processes
    of a global :class:`pool <multiprocessing.pool.Pool>` shared between
    different instances of :class:`~pygmo.mp_bfe`. The pool is created
    either implicitly by the construction of the first :class:`~pygmo.mp_bfe`
    object or explicitly via the :func:`~pygmo.mp_bfe.init_pool()`
    static method. The default number of processes in the pool is equal to
    the number of logical CPUs on the current machine. The pool's size can
    be queried via :func:`~pygmo.mp_bfe.get_pool_size()`, and changed via
    :func:`~pygmo.mp_bfe.resize_pool()`. The pool can be stopped via
    :func:`~pygmo.mp_bfe.shutdown_pool()`.

    .. note::

       Due to certain implementation details of CPython, it is not possible to initialise, resize or shutdown the pool
       from a thread different from the main one. Normally this is not a problem, but, for instance, if the first
       :class:`~pygmo.mp_bfe` instance is created in a thread different from the main one, an error
       will be raised. In such a situation, the user should ensure to call :func:`~pygmo.mp_bfe.init_pool()`
       from the main thread before spawning the secondary thread.

    .. warning::

       Due to internal limitations of CPython, sending an interrupt signal (e.g., by pressing ``Ctrl+C`` in an interactive
       Python session) while an :class:`~pygmo.mp_bfe` is running might end up sending an interrupt signal also to the
       external process(es). This can lead to unpredictable runtime behaviour (e.g., the session may hang). Although
       pygmo tries hard to limit as much as possible the chances of this occurrence, it cannot eliminate them completely. Users
       are thus advised to tread carefully with interrupt signals (especially in interactive sessions) when using
       :class:`~pygmo.mp_bfe`.

    .. warning::

       Due to an `upstream bug <https://bugs.python.org/issue38501>`_, when using Python 3.8 the multiprocessing
       machinery may lead to a hangup when exiting a Python session. As a workaround until the bug is resolved, users
       are advised to explicitly call :func:`~pygmo.mp_bfe.shutdown_pool()` before exiting a Python session.
