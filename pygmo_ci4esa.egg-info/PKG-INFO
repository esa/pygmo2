        pygmo is a scientific Python library for massively parallel optimization. It is built around the idea
        of providing a unified interface to optimization algorithms and to optimization problems and to make their
        deployment in massively parallel environments easy.
        
        If you are using pygmo as part of your research, teaching, or other activities, we would be grateful if you could star
        the repository and/or cite our work. The DOI of the latest version and other citation resources are available
        at [this link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1045336).

        Upgrading from pygmo 1.x.x
        ==========================
        
        If you were using the old pygmo, have a look here on some technical data on what and why a completely new API
        and code was developed: https://github.com/esa/pagmo2/wiki/From-1.x-to-2.x
        
        You will find many tutorials in the documentation, we suggest to skim through them to realize the differences.
        The new pygmo (version 2) should be considered (and is) as an entirely different code.
